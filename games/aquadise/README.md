# Aquadise

A cozy 2D pixel-art diving game: swim an open underwater world, catch fictional creatures with a
net, and bring them home to biome-themed aquarium tanks.

**Stack:** plain HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JavaScript. No build step and no dependencies.

## Run it

Open `index.html` in a browser. Double-clicking works in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. A local server is
the most reliable option:

```sh
npx http-server -c-1 .      # or: python3 -m http.server
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

In the aquarium: **Q/E** switch tanks, **F** feeds, **T** (or TANKS) shows every tank at a glance.
Drag a tray item into the tank (or click it, then click in the tank). Drag a placed item to move it;
right-click or **Delete** removes it. Tray pieces show ♥ when a creature in the tank loves them and a
green dot when they suit the tank's theme (best ones first; hover for details). While carrying a piece,
a toolbar offers FLIP, LAYER, PUT BACK and REMOVE. **X** flips the held or hovered piece, **Z** moves it in front of / behind everything,
**U** (or UNDO, Ctrl+Z) undoes the last decor change, and CLEAR (click twice) empties the tank's decor.
Click a creature for its info card. Hover the stars for what's helping and what's missing. The
**FISH** tray moves creatures between the tank and storage.

**Photo mode** (tank screen: the PHOTO button or **P**): the buttons, trays, hints and info cards
hide and a camera frame shows. **Space** or a click in the tank takes a picture: a shutter sound, a
quick white flash, and a PNG downloads at 3x the game's pixels (nearest-neighbour, no blurring), named
like `Aquadise-TidePools-2026-10-03.png`, with a small "Saved!" preview. **Z** freezes the creatures
so you can pose a shot, **I** hides or shows hearts and mood icons, **F** cycles the frame (none,
pixel border, polaroid) and **C** turns the caption (tank name, stars, date) on for the first two
(the polaroid always has one). **P** or **Esc** leaves. Works on every tank, predator tanks included.
Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.photo` (key, scale, default frame, flash, preview time). When the game is opened
straight from disk (file://) the sprites load from `assets/sprites-embedded.js` (kept in sync by
`tools/gen-placeholders.js`, or run `node tools/embed-sprites.js` after replacing art), because
browsers won't let a page save pictures made from file:// images.

## How it plays

- **Title screen (home):** the world drifts by behind the logo. Continue, New Game (asks to
  confirm when a save exists) or Controls. Esc → Home returns to it from the game.

- **Catching.** Creatures react to how close and how fast you are. Sneak, or drop bait to lure
  them out, then net them. Each species uses a reusable catch behaviour (hides, darts, schools,
  camouflage, timing windows, patrols, needs coaxing, and so on). The log lists a tip for every species.
- **Collection log tabs:** SPECIES (each biome's species, families grouped under a heading),
  VARIANTS (every rare colour variant, grouped by biome, with a "VARIANTS n/total" count) and NOTES
  (field notes from message bottles). Left/Right arrows or a click switch tabs; Q/E or the < >
  buttons switch biome. All counts are worked out from the data.
- **Tide Pools are dry land** (merged from the Milestone 2 prototype): you walk and jump on the
  shore and only swim once the water is deep enough to submerge you. Shallow pools are splashed
  through and deep ones can be swum in. Tap a pool with the net to try for a Glasswinged Minnow.
- **The sunken ship** in the Sunken Ruins has a door at the bow, a cabin door and two hatches.
  They open by themselves as you swim up and close behind you (listed in `data/world.js` `doors`).
- **Upgrades from chests:** NET, SPD, LAMP (wider light in dark places) and DEEP (how deep you can
  dive before the water gets heavy: you slow down, the view softens and you drift back up, never
  any damage). Limits are in `upgrades.depthLimitY`; level 0 reaches everything except the bottom of the
  trench's rounded floor, which each level lets you sink a little further into (level 3 reaches the bottom).
- **New catch behaviours:** `mirror` (copies your swimming mirrored; hold still and it drifts in),
  `lure` (a glowing decoy on a stalk; net the dim creature beside it, not the light) and `midair`
  (leaps out of the water; only nettable in the air). See the header of data/creatures.js.
- **Nine new creatures:** Auroravein Squid (ice, night), Moonshell Crab (tide pools,
  night), Ribbonmane (kelp, mirror), Candlepolyp (coral plant, blooms at night), Skyleap Flyfish
  (open ocean, mid-air), Sail Turtle (open ocean), Pressure Tortoise (bottom of the trench, depth 3),
  Bellcrab (ruins) and Firefly Frog (mangrove, night, lure). Existing creatures have no new gates.
- **Axolotls (Lush Cave):** five natural colours, each its own species with its own log entry,
  sexes and breeding: Azalea (pink), Aurum (gold), Pluvia (cyan), Viridis (green) and Navious (blue).
  A pair always has babies of its own colour. They share a `family: 'axolotl'` tag, so the log groups
  them under an AXOLOTL heading. Azalea and Viridis are common, Pluvia and Navious uncommon and Aurum
  rare: the weights (and how many axolotls are out at once) are `AQ.data.families.axolotl` in
  `data/creatures.js`. Their rare bred variant is a pattern (white with gold speckles), not a hue
  shift, so it never looks like one of the five colours. Older saves: the pale pink lush-cave species
  they replace becomes the Azalea Axolotl (catches, log, tanks, storage, eggs and courting pairs).
- **Message bottles + field notes:** one bottle per species, lying on the seabed, on the Tide Pools
  shore or bobbing at the surface in that species' biome. They glint softly; swim (or walk) into one
  to pick it up, like a chest. Found bottles are saved and never come back. Each holds a field
  researcher's notes on its species (`data/lore.js`): an epithet, an invented scientific name and a
  few lines of biology. The species' name only appears once you've caught it ("this creature"
  until then). Read them on a species' entry page (ENTER or click in the SPECIES tab, in its Field
  Notes section) or in the NOTES tab, grouped by biome. The log header shows "BOTTLES FOUND n/total".
  Placement is the same every time (seeded), never inside terrain, and every bottle can be reached
  without any upgrade (checked with the sea scene's own "can the player be here" test and a flood
  fill from the start that stops at the level-0 depth limit). Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.bottles`
  (pickup radius, glint, glow, spacing, share floating at the surface).
- **Distant seagulls:** wherever the sky shows (the sea surface, the Tide Pools shore and the hill),
  a small flock of 1-4 tiny V-shaped gulls now and then drifts slowly across, flapping between two
  wing frames and moving less than the camera so they feel far away. Day, dawn and dusk only (they
  fade away at night), tinted to suit the sky; scenery only. A very faint, rate-limited gull cry plays
  as a flock passes, through the ambience volume (and mute). Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.gulls` (how often,
  most flocks at once, flock size, speed, parallax, flap speed, cry volume and gap).
- **No fail state.** Hostile creatures only knock you back. Air is unlimited.
- **Progression** comes only from chests: a bigger net (3 levels) and faster swimming (3 levels).
  Six chests exist at a time, and they despawn and respawn around the world.
- **Getting to the aquarium.** Walk left off the far edge of Tide Pools (by the little signpost)
  and the screen fades to a separate hill scene. Walk up the hill and stand in the UFO's beam,
  then press **E**: you're lifted up and arrive in the aquarium building, which floats in space.
  Inside there's normal gravity. Walk, jump and climb the ladders, and press **E** at a tank to tend
  it, or at the DIRECTORY console for the overview of every tank. The BEAM PAD on the ground floor
  (**E**) sends you back to the hilltop. Optional: **V** zooms out to the whole building so you see every
  tank at once, while you keep control of the robot (default in `AQ.TUNING.station`, your choice is saved); walk down the hill's right edge to return to Tide Pools.
  The hill and the building are their own scenes and never appear on the world map. The game
  saves which scene you're in. Caught creatures still go straight to their tank. (The old Tab
  shortcut is a test-only setting: `AQ.TUNING.debug.tabOpensAquarium`, off by default.)
- **Predator wing.** The building's 4th floor holds 5 predator tanks (Reef, Open-Water, Deep, Cave
  and Swamp Hunters). Every creature marked `predator` lives there instead of in its biome's tank;
  the grouping is data in `data/aquarium.js` (`predatorTanks`). Each floor has 5 tank slots
  (`data/scenes.js`); unused slots stay dark. Old saves move predators over automatically.
  Creatures only get nervous when a tank is crowded (more than `aquarium.nervousAbove`).
- **Sexes.** Every animal is ♂ or ♀ (plants have none; `sexes: 'none'` in data/creatures.js
  opts a species out). Males have a small cyan marking. The log tracks both: a species is
  *discovered* when you catch either sex and *complete* with both. Once you have one sex, the other
  spawns more often (`sexes.missingBias`).
- **Breeding (optional).** A ♂ and ♀ of the same species living in one tank may court (they swim
  together with hearts) when the tank has at least `breeding.minStars`, was fed recently, nobody
  is nervous and there's room. Then an egg appears (a baby for mammals) and later hatches; babies
  grow up over `breeding.growMinutes`. It all runs on real time, wherever you are in the game. The
  log marks species you've bred with a ♥. Nothing requires it.
- **Day and night.** The sea has a calm clock (`clock.dayMinutes`, 6 real minutes per day by default)
  with dawn, day, dusk and night; nights are darker and bluer near the surface, while deep and cave
  areas look the same as before. The HUD shows a sun, sunrise or moon. Creatures with
  `active: 'night'` only come out at night and fade away at dawn. Testing: set
  `debug.timeSkip: true` and press **N** in the sea to jump ahead `clock.skipHours`.
- **Rare colour variants.** A baby born in a tank has a small chance (`breeding.variantChance`, 4%) to
  be a rare colour variant (✦). Only bred babies, never wild ones. The log's VARIANTS tab lists every
  species that can have one (every animal that can breed: plants and sexless species can't) as a
  "normal > rare" card. The rare colour stays hidden until you breed it; until then its box shows the
  next step (the missing ♂ or ♀, ♂♀ = put a pair in its tank, ♥ = a pair is breeding), and the panel
  below spells it out.
- **Aquarium.** One tank per biome, and a creature can only live in its own biome's tank.
  Nothing ever dies and nothing is punished:
  - **Tank vibe (0-5 stars):** decor variety and amount, biome-themed pieces, plants, being fed
    recently, calm (no predator stress), room to swim, and creatures having things they like.
    Weights and targets are in `AQ.TUNING.aquarium` (`src/vibe.js` does the maths).
  - **Likes and mood:** each creature has one or two `likes` (decor/plant tags). It visits liked
    things and does a happy idle there with hearts and sparkles. A small icon shows its mood:
    heart = delighted, sparkle = happy, ".." = uneasy, blinking drop = nervous.
  - **Everyday life:** creatures rest on rocks and logs, tuck into hideouts, graze plants, swim
    in schools, nap, drift and blow bubbles. FEED tips a shaker and everyone gathers to munch.
    Predators make smaller tankmates nervous (they hide but are never hurt).
  - **Decor:** basics plus themed pieces for every biome. Dark tanks (trench, cave, vents, lush
    cave) glow around light pieces. Each biome has its own water colours, light and particles
    (`data/aquarium.js`).
  - **Unlocks:** when a tank first reaches 2, 3.5 and 5 stars it unlocks new themed decor for
    that biome. There is no currency or shop.
  - **Overview (TANKS):** stars, species count and who's nervous or hungry, for every tank.

## Sound and music

Everything you hear is generated in code: soft effects, a quiet ambience bed for each place, and
gentle generative music. Sound starts on your first click or key press (browsers don't allow it
before that), and pauses while the tab is hidden.

- **Settings:** title screen → SOUND, or Esc → SOUND. MUSIC and EFFECTS volume, MUTE, and the
  SOUND TEST. They're saved with the game (New Game keeps them). **O** mutes or unmutes anywhere.
- **Sound test:** SOUND → SOUND TEST lists every effect, ambience bed and music piece (day and
  night versions, plus the reward phrase). Click one to hear it. Beds and music loop until clicked
  again. Each entry shows its id.
- **Feel:** effects and ambience are muffled while you're underwater and open up on land (hill,
  shore, station). Places crossfade into each other, and the log, map and pause menu duck the
  music to about half.
- **Music:** ambient by default: slow, with a soft pad that never stops, long airy notes and lots
  of echo (`musicAmbient` in config: 1 = ambient, 0 = livelier and pluckier). Each place has its own
  key, tempo, instruments and short tune (`data/music.js`).
  One shared motif comes back everywhere, voiced by each place's lead instrument. Phrases are
  sparse, with long rests. At night the sea pieces play slower, quieter and darker.
- **Creature sounds:** rare and quiet. One nearby creature makes a little sound every so often,
  by category, or its own `voice:` in `data/creatures.js`.
- **Recordings:** footsteps on sand and grass, and going into and climbing out of the water, use real recordings
  (single steps cut from the walking clips in `assets/audio/`; a random one plays each step).
  To swap any other sound for a file, put it in `assets/audio/`, map its id in
  `AQ.data.audioFiles` (`data/music.js`), and run `node tools/embed-audio.js` so it also plays when
  the game is opened straight from disk. Effects use their id, beds use `amb:<place>`, and music
  uses `music:<piece>`.
- **Tuning** (`AQ.TUNING.audio` in `src/config.js`): `master` (overall volume), `musicAmbient`, `musicPace`
  (tempo), `musicRest` (silence between phrases), `creatureVoiceEvery` (seconds between creature
  sounds), plus the default volumes, ambience level, crossfade time, menu duck, underwater muffle
  and the mute key.

### Adding content (data only)

- **New creature:** add an entry to `data/creatures.js` that uses an existing `catch_behavior`,
  run `node tools/gen-placeholders.js` for a placeholder sprite, and it spawns in its biome.
- **New biome:** add a biome rect, palette and props to `data/world.js`, adjust the `floor`
  profile or add `shapes`, then add creatures with that `biome` id. Its tank, log page and map
  label appear automatically.
- **Real art:** drop PNGs over the placeholders, following `docs/SPRITE_SPEC.md`.

## Milestones

1. Swimming, camera, pixel pipeline: done
2. Tide Pools terrain (terrain-first bitmaps): done
3. Creature data, behaviours, net catching: done
4. Tanks, decorations, idle behaviour, collection log: done
5. Chests with upgrades and respawn: done
6. Remaining biomes through data and terrain: done

## Simple choices made for the open questions

- **Bait:** unlimited. One piece in the water at a time, and dropping a new one replaces it.
  It sinks, lasts 22 s, and lures nearby calm creatures.
- **Decorations:** 13 base pieces plus one themed piece per biome are always available and
  unlimited. Three more per biome unlock through tank happiness. Harvested plants are added with
  counts, and placing one uses one up. Removing a plant returns it to your stock.
- **Fed** lasts 20 real minutes, then fades over 40 more. A hungry tank only loses a little vibe.
- **Tank capacity:** 12 creatures per tank, with extras going to that tank's storage (swap them in
  the FISH tray). Up to 40 decorations per tank.
- **Saving:** automatic to `localStorage` every 10 s, when leaving the aquarium, and on page
  close. Esc → Reset save wipes it.
- **Audio:** all made in code with the Web Audio API (no audio files). See *Sound and music* below.
- **Getting home:** the walk to the hill and the UFO (see above). The title screen's AQUARIUM
  button still opens the tank screen directly. Caught creatures go to their tank immediately.
- Plants can decorate any tank. Only creatures are restricted to their own biome.
- On land, Shift is careful walking (same stealth rule as sneaking underwater), not a sprint.
  Space jumps; the net is left-click only.
- Rare Trenchmaw: each time its slot (re)spawns there's a 45% chance it appears, re-rolled every 60 s.
