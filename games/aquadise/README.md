# Aquadise

A cozy 2D pixel-art diving game: swim an open underwater world, catch fictional creatures with a
net, and bring them home to biome-themed aquarium tanks.

**Stack:** plain HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JavaScript. No build step and no dependencies.

## Run it

Open `index.html` in a browser. Double-clicking works in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. A local server is
the most reliable option:

```sh
npx http-server -c-1 .      # or: python3 -m http.server
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

### Touch screens (phones, tablets)

Touch controls turn on by themselves with the first touch (**SETTINGS > TOUCH > TOUCH CONTROLS**:
AUTO / ON / OFF, saved). Hold the device sideways: in portrait a "Rotate your device" screen shows and
the game waits. The game fills the screen (keeping its shape, clear of notches and the home bar),
and the controls sit in the black side bars where there's room, or over the game's edges:

| action | touch |
|---|---|
| swim / walk / climb ladders | the joystick: put a thumb down anywhere in the lower part of the left side and slide (it appears under your thumb; a small push does nothing) |
| jump | **JUMP** (up arrow), or push the joystick far up on land |
| sneak | **SNEAK** (footprints) turns it on / off; it lights up and SNEAKING shows in the HUD |
| net | tap the game where you want to swing; keep the finger down after the swing to pry. A quick tap in the joystick area swings there too |
| drop bait | **BAIT** (sea only) |
| interact (beam up/down, a tank, the directory) | **INTERACT** (a hand) shows up whenever the game shows a prompt |
| log, map, guide, help, mute, pause, settings | **MENU** (top corner) opens a panel with all of them |

Keyboard and mouse keep working at the same time. **SWAP SIDES** (same settings tab) puts the
joystick on the right and the buttons on the left. The controls fade when you haven't touched them
for a few seconds. Sizes, positions, fading and the joystick's feel are in `AQ.TUNING.touch`. To try
them on a computer, set `AQ.TUNING.debug.forceTouch: true`: the controls show and the mouse acts as a
finger (drag in the joystick area, click the buttons).

In the aquarium: **Q/E** switch tanks, **F** feeds, **T** (or TANKS) shows every tank at a glance.
In a bigger (expanded) tank: **A/D** or **Left/Right** scroll it sideways (Q/E still switch tanks;
in a size-0 tank the arrows switch tanks as before), or drag the water, use the mouse wheel over it,
or click / drag the thin strip on the tank's lower rim.
Drag a tray item into the tank (or click it, then click in the tank). Drag a placed item to move it;
right-click or **Delete** removes it. Tray pieces show ♥ when a creature in the tank loves them and a
green dot when they suit the tank's theme (best ones first; hover for details). While carrying a piece,
a toolbar offers FLIP, LAYER, PUT BACK and REMOVE. **X** flips the held or hovered piece, **Z** moves it in front of / behind everything,
**U** (or UNDO, Ctrl+Z) undoes the last decor change, and CLEAR (click twice) empties the tank's decor.
Click a creature for its info card. Hover the stars for what's helping and what's missing. The
**FISH** tray moves creatures between the tank and storage.

**Photo mode** (tank screen: the PHOTO button or **P**): the buttons, trays, hints and info cards
hide and a camera frame shows. **Space** or a click in the tank takes a picture: a shutter sound, a
quick white flash, and a PNG downloads at 3x the game's pixels (nearest-neighbour, no blurring), named
like `Aquadise-TidePools-2026-10-03.png`, with a small "Saved!" preview. **Z** freezes the creatures
so you can pose a shot, **I** hides or shows hearts and mood icons, **F** cycles the frame (none,
pixel border, polaroid) and **C** turns the caption (tank name, stars, date) on for the first two
(the polaroid always has one). **P** or **Esc** leaves. Works on every tank, predator tanks included.
Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.photo` (key, scale, default frame, flash, preview time). When the game is opened
straight from disk (file://) the sprites load from `assets/sprites-embedded.js` (kept in sync by
`tools/gen-placeholders.js`, or run `node tools/embed-sprites.js` after replacing art), because
browsers won't let a page save pictures made from file:// images.

## How it plays

- **Title screen (home):** the world drifts by behind the logo. Continue, New Game (asks to
  confirm when a save exists) or Controls. Esc → Home returns to it from the game.

- **Catching.** Creatures react to how close and how fast you are. Sneak, or drop bait to lure
  them out, then net them. Each species uses a reusable catch behaviour (hides, darts, schools,
  camouflage, timing windows, patrols, needs coaxing, and so on). The log lists a tip for every species.
- **Collection log tabs:** SPECIES (each biome's species, families grouped under a heading),
  VARIANTS (every rare colour variant, grouped by biome, with a "VARIANTS n/total" count) and NOTES
  (field notes from message bottles). Left/Right arrows or a click switch tabs; Q/E or the < >
  buttons switch biome. All counts are worked out from the data.
- **Tide Pools are dry land** (merged from the Milestone 2 prototype): you walk and jump on the
  shore and only swim once the water is deep enough to submerge you. Shallow pools are splashed
  through and deep ones can be swum in. Tap a pool with the net to try for a Glasswinged Minnow.
- **The sunken ship** in the Sunken Ruins has a door at the bow, a cabin door and two hatches.
  They open by themselves as you swim up and close behind you (listed in `data/world.js` `doors`).
- **Upgrades from chests:** NET, SPD, LAMP (wider light in dark places) and DEEP (how deep you can
  dive before the water gets heavy: you slow down, the view softens and you drift back up, never
  any damage). Limits are in `upgrades.depthLimitY`; level 0 reaches everything except the bottom of the
  trench's rounded floor, which each level lets you sink a little further into (level 3 reaches the bottom).
- **The collection-log button:** the discovered counter in the HUD's top-right corner ("31/77") is also
  a button, with a small book beside it. Click or tap it to open the collection log, just like L (which
  still works, as do the touch MENU and the title screen). It still shows the count exactly as before.
  - **Looks:** it lights up on hover with a tooltip, "COLLECTION LOG (L)" (the key name follows the
    binding; there's no tooltip with touch), and presses in while held.
  - **Safe to click:** a click or tap on it is used up, so it never swings the net or reaches anything
    underneath. With touch, its hit area grows to a thumb-sized 44 screen pixels without looking any
    different, and it never covers the touch MENU button.
  - **When it works:** everywhere the counter shows: the sea (also with the map open), the hill and the
    aquarium building. It's dimmed and does nothing whenever the log key wouldn't work (a scene
    transition, the guided dive's first question, the touch MENU panel, pause and the other menus), so
    it never opens on top of another menu.
  - **The glow:** until you've clicked it once (saved), it glows gently every few seconds, so players who
    don't read know it's a button.
  - The controls hint, the Guide's log page, the catch tip and the guided dive's log step ("click the
    counter, or press L"; on touch, "tap the counter") mention it.
  - Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.logButton` (`pulseEvery` 6 s, `pulseSeconds` 1.2 s, `touchPx` 44).
- **Glass panes (building material):** the one material used for every tank. Every chest holds 2-4
  panes on top of its upgrade; once all four upgrades are maxed, a chest holds only panes ("You found
  3 glass panes!"). The amount shows in the chest's toast. A small counter (a pane icon and the
  number) sits in the top-right corner of the HUD under the clock, once you've found any, and on the
  TANKS overview. Saved with the game; older saves start with 0. The first time you get some, a tip
  explains them. The name is `pane.name` in `data/lang/en.js` (change it there and every text follows).
  Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.panes` (`chestMin`, `chestMax`). **Testing:** set `debug.hundredPanes: true` in
  `src/config.js` and every game you load or start has 100 panes.
- **Bigger tanks (SIZE 0-3):** every tank, the nursery included, has a SIZE level, saved per tank
  (`AQ.State.tanks[id].size`; older saves are all size 0, today's tank). The tank screen's third tray
  tab, **TANK**, shows `SIZE n/3`, the counts and your panes, and an **EXPAND: 20** button with a pane
  icon. It's greyed out with the reason beside it ("Need 12 more glass panes." / "As big as a tank
  gets.", MAX SIZE). Pressing it asks first (what it costs, how much room the next size gives), then
  plays a soft building sound (TANK EXPANDED in the Sound Test) while a seam of new glass sweeps out
  to the new end of the tank, a blueprint until it arrives, and the view follows it.
  - **Physically wider, never squashed:** each size is wider (312, 468, 624, 780 px), drawn at the same
    crisp scale. The screen shows 312 px at a time and scrolls sideways (keys above, dragging the water
    with a mouse or a finger, the wheel, the strip on the lower rim, or carrying a piece to the edge of
    the view). Small arrows at the view's edges show there's more tank that way. Placing, moving,
    flipping and layering decor, info cards, hover and tap tooltips, the vibe tooltip, feeding (the
    shaker sprinkles where you're looking), undo and photo mode all work anywhere along it.
  - **Photo mode** captures the whole tank, however wide (in photo mode, scroll with the keys or by
    dragging; a tap that doesn't drag takes the photo).
  - **Room:** creatures spawn and swim across the whole width; capacity is read from the tank's size
    everywhere (new catches, moving creatures in from storage, graduates, old-save moves, the "12/18"
    count in the top bar, the nursery's room and its "breeding paused" limit). Crowding scales with the
    room: a tank's "comfortable" and "nervous above" numbers grow in proportion, so 12 creatures in a
    size-1 tank feel roomy, not crowded.
  - **In the building:** each tank's window keeps its size; a bigger tank's window slowly pans across
    the whole tank and back (`station.windowPanSeconds`), and shows a few more of its creatures.
  - Tuning (`AQ.TUNING.tank`): `capacity` [12, 18, 24, 30], `decorCapacity` [40, 60, 80, 100],
    `expandCost` [10, 20, 35] panes, `width` [312, 468, 624, 780]; the nursery's room by size is
    `nursery.capacity` [20, 30, 40, 50]; scrolling speeds `aquarium.scroll`; the animation length
    `aquarium.buildSeconds`; the keys `keys.scrollLeft` / `keys.scrollRight`.
- **ONE PAIR EACH (TANK tab):** arranges the tank to show one ♂ and one ♀ of every species that
  lives there (two of a species without sexes), bringing creatures in from the tank's storage and
  sending the extras to storage. It always asks first ("Move 7 extras to storage and bring 2 from
  storage into the tank?", CONFIRM / CANCEL) and never removes anything: creatures only move between
  the tank and its own storage. Which one is shown, best first: a rare variant (✦), an adult over a
  still-growing baby, one already in the tank (so nothing swaps for no reason), then the oldest. A
  courting pair always stays (it is already a ♂ and a ♀), so breeding carries on; that's the one case a
  rare variant may wait in storage instead. A species with only one sex collected shows the one it has.
  If every pair doesn't fit the room, complete pairs go in first (the species you have the most of
  first), then singles, and the question says what waits in storage and which size fits them all
  ("A pair of each needs room for 18: expand the tank to size 1"). Logic: `src/pairs.js`. Not in the
  nursery.
- **Releasing creatures:** every info card has **RELEASE**: a creature in the tank (click it), one
  waiting in storage (the small "i" on its FISH-tray tile opens its card, with INTO TANK and RELEASE) or a
  baby in the nursery. The TANK tab has **RELEASE EXTRAS** and **SELECT TO RELEASE**. A released creature
  swims up and away with a sparkle and a soft chime (RELEASE CHIME in the Sound Test), with a quiet note
  ("Goodbye, Ribbonmane! Released into the sea."). It's simply removed from your collection: no wild
  respawn trick, and nothing else changes. The log's discovered species, the ♂ / ♀ slots, the
  rare-variant marks, the "bred" marker and the catch counts all stay exactly as they are
  (`src/release.js` never touches the log). A courting pair that loses one simply stops courting.
  - **Always asks:** every release asks for confirmation first.
  - **A second, clearly worded question** comes before releasing a rare variant (✦), the last ♂ or ♀ of
    a species you have (or the last one of a species without sexes), a nursery baby or one still growing
    ("This is a rare variant (✦). Release it anyway?", RELEASE ANYWAY / CANCEL).
  - **RELEASE EXTRAS** only takes from the tank's storage, never from the tank itself or the nursery. It
    keeps one pair of every species (the same pair ONE PAIR EACH would show), every rare variant, the
    last of a sex and anything still growing, and shows a preview first ("Release 9 creatures from
    storage? Keeping one pair of every species, all rare variants and anything still growing.").
  - **SELECT TO RELEASE** is the careful way: the tray shows the storage creatures, a tap or click
    picks one (a warm frame and a tick), and RELEASE n / DONE replace the tabs. If any picked one
    deserves a second look, you're asked about those first (RELEASE THEM TOO / KEEP THOSE), then the
    final CONFIRM. Esc or DONE leaves select mode.
  - Tuning: `aquarium.releaseSeconds` (how long the swim-away takes).
- **New catch behaviours:** `mirror` (copies your swimming mirrored; hold still and it drifts in),
  `lure` (a glowing decoy on a stalk; net the dim creature beside it, not the light) and `midair`
  (leaps out of the water; only nettable in the air). See the header of data/creatures.js.
- **Nine new creatures:** Auroravein Squid (ice, night), Moonshell Crab (tide pools,
  night), Ribbonmane (kelp, mirror), Candlepolyp (coral plant, blooms at night), Skyleap Flyfish
  (open ocean, mid-air), Sail Turtle (open ocean), Pressure Tortoise (bottom of the trench, depth 3),
  Bellcrab (ruins) and Firefly Frog (mangrove, night, lure). Existing creatures have no new gates.
- **Axolotls (Lush Cave):** five natural colours, each its own species with its own log entry,
  sexes and breeding: Azalea (pink), Aurum (gold), Pluvia (cyan), Viridis (green) and Navious (blue).
  A pair always has babies of its own colour. They share a `family: 'axolotl'` tag, so the log groups
  them under an AXOLOTL heading. Azalea and Viridis are common, Pluvia and Navious uncommon and Aurum
  rare: the weights (and how many axolotls are out at once) are `AQ.data.families.axolotl` in
  `data/creatures.js`. Their rare bred variant is a pattern (white with gold speckles), not a hue
  shift, so it never looks like one of the five colours. Older saves: the pale pink lush-cave species
  they replace becomes the Azalea Axolotl (catches, log, tanks, storage, eggs and courting pairs).
- **Message bottles + field notes:** one bottle per species, lying on the seabed, on the Tide Pools
  shore or bobbing at the surface in that species' biome. They glint softly; swim (or walk) into one
  to pick it up, like a chest. Found bottles are saved and never come back. Each holds a field
  researcher's notes on its species (`lore.<id>.*` in `data/lang/en.js`): an epithet, an invented scientific name and a
  few lines of biology. The species' name only appears once you've caught it ("this creature"
  until then). Read them on a species' entry page (ENTER or click in the SPECIES tab, in its Field
  Notes section) or in the NOTES tab, grouped by biome. The log header shows "BOTTLES FOUND n/total". Pickup toasts (and every other toast)
  sit just above the controls hint at the bottom of the screen while it is showing, never on top of it.
  Placement is the same every time (seeded), never inside terrain, and every bottle can be reached
  without any upgrade (checked with the sea scene's own "can the player be here" test and a flood
  fill from the start that stops at the level-0 depth limit). Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.bottles`
  (pickup radius, glint, glow, spacing, share floating at the surface).
- **Distant seagulls:** wherever the sky shows (the sea surface, the Tide Pools shore and the hill),
  a small flock of 1-4 tiny V-shaped gulls now and then drifts slowly across, flapping between two
  wing frames and moving less than the camera so they feel far away. Day, dawn and dusk only (they
  fade away at night), tinted to suit the sky; scenery only. A very faint, rate-limited gull cry plays
  as a flock passes, through the ambience volume (and mute). Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.gulls` (how often,
  most flocks at once, flock size, speed, parallax, flap speed, cry volume and gap).
- **Shooting stars (scenery):** at night (the shared day/night clock) a thin bright streak with a short
  fading trail now and then crosses the sky wherever it shows: the sea surface, the Tide Pools shore and
  the hill. Under the surface you see a faint glow sliding through the water instead (fading with
  depth). In the aquarium building, which is in space, a streak now and then passes outside a porthole
  you can see, day or night. Each streak has a very soft whoosh on the ambience volume (and mute);
  it's in the Sound Test as SHOOTING STAR. Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.shootingStars` (how often, speed, trail
  length, angle, tints, underwater glow, sound volume).
- **No fail state.** Hostile creatures only knock you back. Air is unlimited.
- **Progression** comes only from chests: a bigger net (3 levels) and faster swimming (3 levels),
  the LAMP and DEEP upgrades, and glass panes for building bigger tanks.
  Six chests exist at a time, and they despawn and respawn around the world.
- **Getting to the aquarium.** Walk left off the far edge of Tide Pools (by the little signpost)
  and the screen fades to a separate hill scene. Walk up the hill and stand in the UFO's beam,
  then press **E**: you're lifted up and arrive in the aquarium building, which floats in space.
  Inside there's normal gravity. Walk, jump and climb the ladders, and press **E** at a tank to tend
  it, or at the DIRECTORY console for the overview of every tank. The BEAM PAD on the ground floor
  (**E**) sends you back to the hilltop. Optional: **V** zooms out to the whole building so you see every
  tank at once, while you keep control of the robot (default in `AQ.TUNING.station`, your choice is saved); walk down the hill's right edge to return to Tide Pools.
  The hill and the building are their own scenes and never appear on the world map. The game
  saves which scene you're in. Caught creatures still go straight to their tank. (The old Tab
  shortcut is a test-only setting: `AQ.TUNING.debug.tabOpensAquarium`, off by default.)
- **One-time tips (optional, never blocking).** Short, friendly tips pop up the first time something
  happens: a creature notices you, your first bait, first catch, closing the log for the first time,
  your first chest, heavy deep water, the first evening, a message bottle, a falling star or meteor
  shower, the hill's UFO beam, the aquarium building, your first tank, a new star level or unlock, a
  ♂/♀ pair sharing a tank, the first courtship and baby, and a creature's first bump. One at a time,
  with a quiet gap between them, in a small box where nothing else draws (out in the world: the top
  centre under the area name; on the tank screen: the bottom-left, over the sand). They never show
  mid-netting, during a transition, in photo mode or in a menu, and any key or click closes one (Esc
  and clicks on the box don't do anything else). Each shows once; seen tips are saved. HINTS ON/OFF and
  RESET TIPS are in the Sound settings (pause menu or title). Older saves skip every tip their own
  progress shows they already know. Text: `tip.*` in `data/lang/en.js` (key names are filled in from the real
  bindings, see below). Sounds: NEW TIP and STEP COMPLETE in the Sound Test. Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.tips`.
- **Optional guided first dive.** NEW GAME on a fresh save asks "Want a quick guided dive?" (YES /
  NO THANKS; Esc is no thanks, and the answer is saved). It's a short checklist shown one step at a
  time in the top-left corner (STEP n OF 9), with a soft glowing ring and arrow near the thing to do:
  walk, hop onto the rocks, wade into the deep water and swim, sneak up on a little minnow, swing the
  net, catch it (a very easy Glasswinged Minnow waits in the water for you: it's a real catch), drop
  bait, open the log, done. Each step completes when you actually do it (a soft chime), nothing ever
  pauses or takes your controls, and if you wander off it just waits (it dims, and hides away from the
  sea). SKIP skips a step, STOP ALL ends it. The last step points out the log button (the counter) and
  the Guide. It never changes your progress.
- **REDO TUTORIAL** (pause menu, title screen under CONTROLS and GUIDE, and the Guide's left page) runs the
  guided dive again from anywhere (`src/redo.js`).
  - **It asks first:** "Redo the tutorial?" with "Also show the tips again?" YES / NO (NO by default:
    tips are marked unseen only if you say YES), LET'S GO / CANCEL (Enter / Esc work too).
  - **The trip there:** away from the Tide Pools' start (the hill, the building, a tank screen, far out at
    sea, or the title screen), it says "You'll go to the Tide Pools and come back here after", then fades
    to the starting spot and starts the dive.
  - **The trip back:** when the dive finishes, is skipped through or stopped (STOP ALL), it fades back to
    where you were (the same scene and spot, or the tank screen you came from), with the scene's own
    safety check, and a toast: "Tutorial done! Back where you were." The way back is kept in the save
    (`tutorial.redo`), so a reload mid-dive still brings you back.
  - **Progress stays as it is:** the log, upgrades, bottles, panes, tanks and breeding never change.
    The dive's easy minnow is a real creature, so catching it counts as a normal catch.
  - Tuning: `redo.nearStart` (closer than 400 px to the start, the dive just begins where you are, with
    no trip). Text: `dive.*` in `data/lang/en.js`. Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.dive`. Testing: set
  `debug.tutorialReset: true` and press **R** to restart the dive and reset every tip
  (`debug.tutorialResetKey`).
- **Friendly nudges for players who struggle** (`src/nudges.js`): now and then, a short, light line in
  the tip-box style (top centre, with a small icon and the soft "new tip" sound) when someone seems
  stuck. They never mention the log or the Guide and are never bossy, never pause or block anything,
  and go after 5 seconds or when you do something else (a click on the box closes it too).
  - **Where they can happen:** only active play in the sea counts. Never in a menu, the guided dive (or
    its question), a transition, photo mode or the tank and nursery screens.
  - **Three situations,** each with its own 12 lines (`nudge.*` in `data/lang/en.js`), shuffled so a
    line doesn't repeat until all of its kind have shown (the shuffle is saved):
    - **net spam** (teasing): 12 swings in 20 seconds with no catch (holding to pry isn't a swing), or 4+
      clicks a second for 3 seconds;
    - **no catch for a long time** (encouraging): 4 minutes of active play without a catch (3 in a game
      with nothing caught yet); being away from the keys for more than 20 seconds doesn't count. A bigger
      collection waits longer, since the rare ones take time (`nudges.drought.bySpecies`): 5 minutes
      with 20+ species, 6 with 40+, 7 with 50+, 8 with 60+, 10 with 70+. Never once every species is
      caught (`nudges.drought.maxSpecies` can also stop it from a number of species on). These
      also show a small REDO TUTORIAL button (`nudges.droughtRedoButton`);
    - **key mashing** (silly): the same key that does nothing in the sea (the interact key, say), 6
      times in 8 seconds.
  - **Rate limits:** at most one every 90 seconds and 3 per 10 minutes, none within 60 seconds of a
    catch, and none while a tip or toast is showing (tips wait for a nudge, too). HINTS off turns them
    off, and `nudges.enabled` turns the whole feature off.
  - Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.nudges`. **Testing:** set `debug.nudges: true` and press **Y** in the sea to show
    one right now (it skips the rate limits), cycling net spam, no catch, key mashing
    (`debug.nudgeKey`).
- **The GUIDE.** A small paged field-guide book: from the title screen (GUIDE), the pause menu
  (GUIDE) or the help line's key (**I** by default, `keys.guide`). Left/right, A/D or the arrows turn
  the page; Esc or the guide key closes it. Ten short pages, each with a picture: moving, swimming and
  sneaking; catching (the net, bait and how creatures behave); upgrades and chests; day, night and
  night events; getting to the aquarium; tanks; sexes, breeding and rare colors; the log and message
  bottles; photo mode; sound and settings. A page (or line) about a feature the build doesn't have is
  left out. Text: `guide.*` in `data/lang/en.js` (the page list: `data/tutorial.js`); key names and numbers like the day length or the
  rare-color odds are filled in live from the bindings and config.js (`{k:...}`, `{c:...}`, `{inv:...}`).
- **REDUCE FLASHING.** In SETTINGS > OPTIONS (pause menu or title), saved with your other settings.
  When it's on: the photo camera flash becomes a faint, slow fade instead of a white flash; shooting
  stars, the underwater glow and falling stars are dimmer and slower (and meteor-shower skies calmer);
  a falling star lands with a soft glow instead of a sparkle burst; the UFO beam, its lights and the
  beam pad hold still instead of animating and pulsing (and the station beam eases up instead of
  jumping bright); scene fades are smooth instead of stepped; and fast blinking is held steady: your
  stun blink, the firefly frog's flickering decoy, the map's "you" dot and star marker, the HUD star,
  the meteor-shower sparkle, tank nervous drops, the photo REC dot, NEW labels, the selected-creature
  marker and the Variants outline. A one-time tip mentions it the first time a flash plays; the
  Guide's Sound page too. Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.calm`.
- **Save files and safety.** EXPORT SAVE and IMPORT SAVE are on the title screen and in the pause
  menu.
  - **Export** saves `Aquadise-save-YYYY-MM-DD.json` (it works even when the browser won't let the game
    save). On a phone whose browser can share files, it opens the share sheet ("Save to Files",
    Drive, a message...); everywhere else it's a download.
  - **Why it waits for the click to finish:** some browsers only allow a download, the file picker, the
    share sheet or the clipboard during the click or tap itself, and the game sees a click a frame later.
    So these run when the button is let go (`saveFile.gestureWaitMs`).
  - **COPY SAVE TEXT:** some browsers and embedded pages silently block downloads, so the export message
    always offers COPY SAVE TEXT. It copies the save to the clipboard, or, if the clipboard is blocked too,
    shows it in a text box to copy by hand.
  - **Import** asks CHOOSE FILE or PASTE TEXT (a text box for save text copied that way). Either way the
    save is checked carefully (an Aquadise save, the right structure, a version this game understands)
    and refuses anything else with a friendly message, then asks before replacing your save; the
    imported save loads through the normal loading and migration, just like an old save, and your
    previous save becomes the backup. Saves carry a version number (`AQ.Save.VERSION`, now 3; the
    original v1 saves still load). Before every save the previous good one is kept as a backup. If your
    save can't be read, the title asks whether to restore the backup (or import a file) or start fresh,
    and the unreadable save is never overwritten: starting fresh keeps it aside
    (`aquadise.save.v1.unreadable`). If the browser blocks saving (e.g. private browsing), the game
    keeps running, says so once, and the title / pause screens show a small note.
  - Tuning: `saveFile.maxImportBytes`, `saveFile.gestureWaitMs`.
- **Key bindings in one place:** `AQ.TUNING.keys` in config.js (plus `interactKeys`, `audio.muteKey`,
  `photo.key`, `station.zoomKey`). The game reads them, and the help line, the title's CONTROLS panel
  and every tip show key names from them (`src/keys.js`), so changing a key changes the text too.
- **Falling stars and meteor showers.** Some nights a star visibly falls and lands somewhere in the
  sea or on the shore: always a spot you can reach at upgrade level 0 (the same scan and checks as the
  message bottles), with a clear drop from the sky (never in a cave), never inside terrain, past the
  depth limit or on top of you. It lands with a burst and a soft descending chime, and a soft light
  column rises from the spot so you can find it from far away. In open water a small group of Starfall
  Minnows appears; on the shore or the sandy seabed, an Aerolite Crab. They glow, wait a few real
  minutes (`lingerMinutes`, default 3) and then fade out slowly (once faint they can't be netted).
  They're caught like anything else and follow the usual ♂/♀ balancing (the sex you're missing is more
  likely). A toast says where it fell ("A shooting star fell near the Kelp Forest!"), the map (M) shows
  a sparkling star at the spot, and a little star sits next to the HUD moon while something is waiting.
  - **Meteor showers:** on rarer nights (about one in 5-6) the sky fills with shooting stars all night
    and 2-4 stars land at different spots; each landing may also bring a Comet Ray. It's announced at
    dusk ("The sky is full of falling stars tonight") with a gentle shimmering music cue and a small
    sparkle next to the HUD moon. The cue (METEOR SHOWER) and the landing chime (STAR LANDS) are in the
    Sound Test.
  - **Schedule:** nights are counted at dusk and each night's plan is seeded from the world seed and
    the night number and saved, so reloading never re-rolls it. Catch-up: a star always falls at least
    every 3 nights. Stars only fall at night and only in the sea, but it all keeps going wherever you
    are (the hill, the building, a tank): come back and the star may still be waiting. Waiting stars
    are saved too.
  - Tuning: `AQ.TUNING.starfall` (star / shower chances, catch-up, stars per shower, Comet Ray chance,
    when in the night they fall, water vs shore, group size, how long they wait and fade, distances,
    the light column, chime volume).
  - Testing: set `debug.starKeys: true` in config.js; then (any time, even by day) **G** makes a
    star fall right now and **J** starts a meteor shower right now (2-4 stars over the next ~20 s).
    The keys are `debug.fallStarKey` / `debug.showerKey`.
- **Starfall tank and its three creatures.** The building's 3rd floor has a new tank, STARFALL: deep
  indigo water, drifting twinkling star motes and a faint glow welling up from the middle. It's in every
  list of tanks (the DIRECTORY / TANKS overview, the whole-building view, Q/E switching, vibe tooltips,
  photo mode). Four themed decorations: Stardust Patch (always available), Meteorite Rock, Crater Bowl
  and Star Lantern (unlock at its 1st, 2nd and 3rd star tiers). Its creatures have no wild spawn; they
  only appear through night events (falling stars and meteor showers):
  - **Starfall Minnow** (fish, darts): tiny and glowing, in small groups where a star lands in water.
  - **Aerolite Crab** (crustacean, wary): a shell like a space rock, where a star lands on the shore or sand.
  - **Comet Ray** (fish, curious): larger, with a glowing tail; only during meteor showers, the rarest.
  They follow the same rules as everything else (♂/♀, breeding, rare variants, likes, moods, photo
  mode). The log gives them their own STARFALL page with "FALLING STARS ONLY" / "METEOR SHOWERS ONLY"
  tags. Each has field notes in a message bottle: the minnow's on the Open Ocean seabed, the crab's
  on the Tide Pools shore, the ray's on the Coral Reef seabed (set by `bottle` in `data/creatures.js`).
  Data: `AQ.data.specialTanks` + `tankStyles.starfall` (data/aquarium.js), the creatures' `event` field.
- **Predator wing.** The building's 4th floor holds 5 predator tanks (Reef, Open-Water, Deep, Cave
  and Swamp Hunters). Every creature marked `predator` lives there instead of in its biome's tank;
  the grouping is data in `data/aquarium.js` (`predatorTanks`). Each floor has 5 tank slots
  (`data/scenes.js`); unused slots stay dark. Old saves move predators over automatically.
  Creatures only get nervous when a tank is crowded (more than `aquarium.nervousAbove`).
- **Sexes.** Every animal is ♂ or ♀ (plants have none; `sexes: 'none'` in data/creatures.js
  opts a species out). Males have a small cyan marking. The log tracks both: a species is
  *discovered* when you catch either sex and *complete* with both. Once you have one sex, the other
  spawns more often (`sexes.missingBias`).
- **Breeding (optional).** A ♂ and ♀ of the same species living in one tank may court (they swim
  together with hearts) when the tank has at least `breeding.minStars`, was fed recently and nobody
  is nervous. When the courtship finishes, the egg (a baby for mammals) appears in the **Universal
  Nursery**, never in the parents' tank, with a little sparkle by the parents if you're watching
  them; eggs hatch there and babies grow up over `breeding.growMinutes`. It all runs on real time,
  wherever you are in the game. The log marks species you've bred with a ♥. Nothing requires it.
  The parents' tank's star tooltip says when an egg is on its way or a baby is in the nursery.
- **The Universal Nursery** (3rd floor, next to Starfall; NURSERY in the directory, the TANKS
  overview, the whole-building view and Q/E). A soft, warm, pastel tank where babies of every species
  and biome live together, predators included: babies never stress, scare or eat each other, so no
  predator rules apply. Only bred babies can be in it, never caught adults. It has its own room
  (`nursery.capacity`, 20, counting babies, grown babies and eggs; shown as ♥ n/20); when it's full,
  breeding pauses everywhere and the parents' tooltip says "BREEDING PAUSED: THE NURSERY IS FULL,
  GRADUATE SOME BABIES". The nursery has no vibe stars, stress or unlocks; feeding still works (just
  for fun). Its four decorations (Shell Cradle, Bubble Mobile, Soft Sand Mound, Little Pebble Nest)
  are free from the start. Older saves: babies still growing and eggs in any tank (or its storage)
  move into the nursery when the save loads, keeping sex, colour and birth time; if it's full the
  rest stay where they are (nothing is ever deleted). Code: `src/nursery.js`, `src/breeding.js`.
  - **Growing up and graduating.** Babies grow up over `breeding.growMinutes`. In the nursery, hover
    (or tap) a baby to see how long it has left; its info card shows its name, sex, rare colour and
    time left, and grown babies wear a little graduation cap. Each grown baby has a GRADUATE button
    (on its card, and under it in the nursery's FISH tray); it sends the baby to the **storage** of
    its home tank (its biome tank, its predator tank, or Starfall for the falling-star creatures),
    with a soft chime (`graduate`, also in the Sound Test) and a message saying where it went.
    GRADUATE ALL (bottom right of the nursery) sends every grown baby at once and says how many went
    where. Babies still growing can't graduate yet (the button shows the time left). If a home tank's
    storage ever has a limit (`tank.storageCapacity`, none by default) and it's full, the baby simply
    stays in the nursery and the message says why. The log's entry shows BRED, how many are IN
    NURSERY and how many GRADUATED.
  - Testing: set `debug.fastNursery: true` in config.js. Courting, hatching, growing up and the rest
    after a birth then take seconds (`debug.fastNurserySeconds`), and a ready pair starts courting at
    once. The usual requirements still apply (a ♂ and ♀ adult in a fed tank with enough stars).
- **Day and night.** A new game starts in the bright mid-morning (10:00, `clock.startHour`); saves keep
  their own time. The sea has a calm clock (`clock.dayMinutes`, 6 real minutes per day by default)
  with dawn, day, dusk and night; nights are darker and bluer near the surface, while deep and cave
  areas look the same as before. The HUD shows a sun, sunrise or moon. Creatures with
  `active: 'night'` only come out at night and fade away at dawn. Testing: set
  `debug.timeSkip: true` and press **N** in the sea to jump ahead `clock.skipHours`.
- **Rare colour variants.** A baby born in a tank has a small chance (`breeding.variantChance`, 4%) to
  be a rare colour variant (✦). Only bred babies, never wild ones. The log's VARIANTS tab lists every
  species that can have one (every animal that can breed: plants and sexless species can't) as a
  "normal > rare" card. The rare colour stays hidden until you breed it; until then its box shows the
  next step (the missing ♂ or ♀, ♂♀ = put a pair in its tank, ♥ = a pair is breeding), and the panel
  below spells it out.
- **Aquarium.** One tank per biome, and a creature can only live in its own biome's tank.
  Nothing ever dies and nothing is punished:
  - **Tank vibe (0-5 stars):** decor variety and amount, biome-themed pieces, plants, being fed
    recently, calm (no predator stress), room to swim, and creatures having things they like.
    Weights and targets are in `AQ.TUNING.aquarium` (`src/vibe.js` does the maths).
  - **Likes and mood:** each creature has one or two `likes` (decor/plant tags). It visits liked
    things and does a happy idle there with hearts and sparkles. A small icon shows its mood:
    heart = delighted, sparkle = happy, ".." = uneasy, blinking drop = nervous.
  - **Everyday life:** creatures rest on rocks and logs, tuck into hideouts, graze plants, swim
    in schools, nap, drift and blow bubbles. FEED tips a shaker and everyone gathers to munch.
    Predators make smaller tankmates nervous (they hide but are never hurt).
  - **Decor:** basics plus themed pieces for every biome. Dark tanks (trench, cave, vents, lush
    cave) glow around light pieces. Each biome has its own water colours, light and particles
    (`data/aquarium.js`).
  - **Unlocks:** when a tank first reaches 2, 3.5 and 5 stars it unlocks new themed decor for
    that biome. There is no currency or shop.
  - **Overview (TANKS):** stars, species count and who's nervous or hungry, for every tank.

## Sound and music

Everything you hear is generated in code: soft effects, a quiet ambience bed for each place, and
gentle generative music. Sound starts on your first click or key press (browsers don't allow it
before that), and pauses while the tab is hidden.

- **Settings:** title screen → SOUND, or Esc → SOUND. MUSIC and EFFECTS volume, MUTE, and the
  SOUND TEST. They're saved with the game (New Game keeps them). **O** mutes or unmutes anywhere.
- **Sound test:** SOUND → SOUND TEST lists every effect, ambience bed and music piece (day and
  night versions, plus the reward phrase). Click one to hear it. Beds and music loop until clicked
  again. Each entry shows its id.
- **Feel:** effects and ambience are muffled while you're underwater and open up on land (hill,
  shore, station). Places crossfade into each other, and the log, map and pause menu duck the
  music to about half.
- **Music:** ambient by default: slow, with a soft pad that never stops, long airy notes and lots
  of echo (`musicAmbient` in config: 1 = ambient, 0 = livelier and pluckier). Each place has its own
  key, tempo, instruments and short tune (`data/music.js`).
  One shared motif comes back everywhere, voiced by each place's lead instrument. Phrases are
  sparse, with long rests. At night the sea pieces play slower, quieter and darker.
- **Creature sounds:** rare and quiet. One nearby creature makes a little sound every so often,
  by category, or its own `voice:` in `data/creatures.js`.
- **Recordings:** footsteps on sand and grass, and going into and climbing out of the water, use real recordings
  (single steps cut from the walking clips in `assets/audio/`; a random one plays each step).
  To swap any other sound for a file, put it in `assets/audio/`, map its id in
  `AQ.data.audioFiles` (`data/music.js`), and run `node tools/embed-audio.js` so it also plays when
  the game is opened straight from disk. Effects use their id, beds use `amb:<place>`, and music
  uses `music:<piece>`.
- **Tuning** (`AQ.TUNING.audio` in `src/config.js`): `master` (overall volume), `musicAmbient`, `musicPace`
  (tempo), `musicRest` (silence between phrases), `creatureVoiceEvery` (seconds between creature
  sounds), plus the default volumes, ambience level, crossfade time, menu duck, underwater muffle
  and the mute key.

## Languages

The game is ready for translation; English is the only language so far. Every text the player sees
comes from a language file in `data/lang/` (English: `data/lang/en.js`), looked up with `t()`
(`src/lang.js`). A key missing in a language falls back to English. **SETTINGS > OPTIONS > LANGUAGE**
picks the language (saved with your settings); by default the game uses the browser's language if
there's a file for it, otherwise English. Dates in photo captions use the language's format (photo
file names stay plain ASCII), and the pixel font's characters live in `data/glyphs.js`: a character
it doesn't have yet draws as a small box. Rules for adding text: `CLAUDE.md`.

**Translating:** see `docs/TRANSLATING.md` for how to add a language, how to test it, which
letters the font has, and a checklist for new text. Right-to-left languages aren't supported yet.
- `node tools/lang-csv.js export de de.csv`: every text in a spreadsheet (key, English,
  translation, where it's used). `node tools/lang-csv.js import de de.csv` turns it back into
  `data/lang/de.js`.
- `node tools/lang-check.js de` (or `--all`): checks a language file against English (missing
  and unknown keys, placeholders that don't match, missing plural forms, letters the font lacks).
- **PSEUDO test language:** set `debug.pseudoLanguage: true` in `src/config.js`, and PSEUDO appears
  under LANGUAGE. Every text is about 40% longer and wrapped in `[!! !!]`, which shows missed
  English and layout trouble.
- **Long text never overflows:** text in buttons, cards, tooltips and titles has a width limit.
  Text that doesn't fit is squeezed narrower, down to `text.squeezeMin` in `src/config.js`, then
  cut short with "..". Button rows widen and re-flow when a label needs more room. None of this
  changes anything in English, where everything already fits.

**Checking the game:** `node tools/check-game.js` opens the game in a headless browser, visits every
main screen (title, settings, sound test, the sea, the map, pause, the guided dive, a tip, the hill,
the building, the directory, every tank, the info cards, photo mode, every log tab, every Guide page,
the touch controls, a save panel) and reports console errors and characters missing from the font.
Options: `--lang en` (or `pseudo`, or any language file; the default is English, then PSEUDO), `--keys` (check language keys), `--dump file.json` (save the text drawn on every screen) and
`--compare a.json b.json` (compare two dumps), `--shots dir` (screenshots). It needs Playwright:
`npm install --no-save playwright && npx playwright install chromium` (a test tool only; the game itself
has no dependencies).

### Adding content (data only)

- **New creature:** add an entry to `data/creatures.js` that uses an existing `catch_behavior`,
  add its name and log hint to `data/lang/en.js` (`creature.<id>.name`, `creature.<id>.hint`, and
  field notes as `lore.<id>.*` if it has some), run `node tools/gen-placeholders.js` for a placeholder
  sprite, and it spawns in its biome.
- **New biome:** add a biome rect, palette and props to `data/world.js` (its names go in
  `data/lang/en.js`: `biome.<id>.name` / `.short`), adjust the `floor`
  profile or add `shapes`, then add creatures with that `biome` id. Its tank, log page and map
  label appear automatically.
- **Text:** every text the player sees lives in `data/lang/en.js` (see `CLAUDE.md`); run
  `node tools/check-game.js --keys --lang none` to check that every key exists and is used.
- **Real art:** drop PNGs over the placeholders, following `docs/SPRITE_SPEC.md`.

## Milestones

1. Swimming, camera, pixel pipeline: done
2. Tide Pools terrain (terrain-first bitmaps): done
3. Creature data, behaviours, net catching: done
4. Tanks, decorations, idle behaviour, collection log: done
5. Chests with upgrades and respawn: done
6. Remaining biomes through data and terrain: done

## Simple choices made for the open questions

- **Bait:** unlimited. One piece in the water at a time, and dropping a new one replaces it.
  It sinks, lasts 22 s, and lures nearby calm creatures.
- **Decorations:** 13 base pieces plus one themed piece per biome are always available and
  unlimited. Three more per biome unlock through tank happiness. Harvested plants are added with
  counts, and placing one uses one up. Removing a plant returns it to your stock.
- **Fed** lasts 20 real minutes, then fades over 40 more. A hungry tank only loses a little vibe.
- **Tank capacity:** 12 creatures per tank, with extras going to that tank's storage (swap them in
  the FISH tray). Up to 40 decorations per tank.
- **Saving:** automatic to `localStorage` every 10 s, when leaving the aquarium, and on page
  close. Esc → Reset save wipes it.
- **Audio:** all made in code with the Web Audio API (no audio files). See *Sound and music* below.
- **Getting home:** the walk to the hill and the UFO (see above). The title screen's AQUARIUM
  button still opens the tank screen directly. Caught creatures go to their tank immediately.
- Plants can decorate any tank. Only creatures are restricted to their own biome.
- On land, Shift is careful walking (same stealth rule as sneaking underwater), not a sprint.
  Space jumps; the net is left-click only.
- Rare Trenchmaw: each time its slot (re)spawns there's a 45% chance it appears, re-rolled every 60 s.
