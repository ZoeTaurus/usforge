# Aquadise sprite spec

Every character, creature, plant and decoration is a **PNG sprite sheet** listed in
`assets/manifest.js`. Replace a placeholder PNG with real art of the **same name and layout** and
it shows up in game with no code changes.

## Sheet layout

- Frames are laid out **left to right**, animations **top to bottom** (one row per animation).
- All frames in a sheet are the same size: the entry's `fw` × `fh`.
- **Everything faces RIGHT.** The engine mirrors sprites for left-facing movement.
- Transparent background (RGBA PNG), no anti-aliasing or soft edges. Hard pixels only.
- Draw at 1:1. Don't upscale. The game renders at 320×180 and scales up with nearest-neighbour.
- Keep a 1 px transparent margin inside each frame so outlines aren't clipped. (The placeholder
  generator now enforces this: it measures all frames and shifts or slightly shrinks the art to fit.)
- A dark 1 px outline and top-light / bottom-shadow shading match the placeholders and terrain.

## Size classes (frame size in px)

| class       | frame   | used for                                                    |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tiny`      | 12 × 12 | snails, minnows, gobies, small decor                       |
| `small`     | 16 × 16 | most fish, crabs, newts, small plants                      |
| `medium`    | 24 × 24 | otters, seals, lanternjaw, larger plants                   |
| `large`     | 32 × 32 | blue runner, sea-lizard, cave crawler, castle/arch decor    |
| `huge`      | 48 × 48 | reeftooth, trenchmaw                                        |
| `tall`      | 16 × 32 | bell kelp, pillar                                           |
| `wide`      | 32 × 16 | eels, snakes, weed mat, driftwood                           |
| `widelarge` | 48 × 24 | dwarf croc                                                  |

The player diver frame is 28 × 40 (anchor 14,20). The swimming and upright poses are the same size (about 22 px). A creature's class is its `sprite_size` in `data/creatures.js`.

## Animations (rows)

| kind               | row 0                      | row 1                    | row 2                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| creature           | `idle`: 4 frames @ 5 fps   | `move`: 4 frames @ 10 fps | —                      |
| plant              | `idle` (sway): 4 @ 3 fps   | —                        | —                      |
| decoration         | `idle`: 1 frame            | —                        | —                      |
| player (28×40)     | `idle`: 4 @ 5 fps          | `swim`: 6 @ 12 fps       | `net` swing: 4 @ 14 fps |
| player, cont.      | row 3 `stand`: 2 @ 2 fps   | row 4 `walk`: 4 @ 9 fps  | row 5 `jump`: 1 frame   |
| chest (16×16)      | col 0 `closed`, col 1 `open` (one row, 2 frames)        |                        |
| bait (8×8)         | `idle` glint: 2 @ 3 fps    |                          |                        |

So a `small` creature sheet is **64 × 32** (4 frames × 16 px, 2 rows), and a `huge` one is 192 × 96.

Camouflage, hiding, stress and similar states are done by the engine (transparency, shaking,
icons), so they need no extra rows.

## Anchor points

The anchor is the pixel inside a frame that sits on the entity's world position.

- **Player:** anchor (14,20). Swimming poses are centred on it (about 22 px long). In the
  upright rows (stand/walk/jump/standnet), the feet go on row 24 (anchor + 4, the bottom of the
  collision box) and the figure is about 22 px tall, matching the swimming size. `standnet` is the upright pose without the front arm, because
  the game draws the reaching arm during a net swing.
- **Creatures, player, bait:** the frame centre `(floor(fw/2), floor(fh/2))`. Centre the body in the frame.
- **Plants, decorations, chests:** bottom-centre `(floor(fw/2), fh-1)`. The bottom row of pixels
  touches the ground, so don't leave empty rows under the base.
- Ceiling clingers (Frost Isopod) are flipped vertically by the engine. Draw them upright.

## Male / female variants

Every animal with two sexes has two sheets with the same size, rows and anchor:

- `creatures/<id>.png` (key `creature.<id>`) is the base art and is used for **females**.
- `creatures/<id>_m.png` (key `creature.<id>.m`) is used for **males**.

The placeholder male is the same art plus a small bright cyan marking on top of the body. Real art
can make the difference anything readable (colour, fin, crest), but keep the size and anchor. If a
`_m` sheet is missing, males fall back to the base sheet. Species with `sexes: 'none'` (and plants)
have no male sheet.

## Juveniles (babies born in the tanks)

Every animal also has a juvenile sheet, `creatures/<id>_baby.png` (key `creature.<id>.baby`), with the
**same frame size, rows and anchor** as the adult. The placeholder is the adult art drawn about 60%
size and lighter, centred in the frame. Babies use it until they grow up, then switch to the adult
(♂ or ♀) sheet. If it's missing, the adult sheet is used.

## File naming

```
assets/sprites/creatures/<creature_id>.png    e.g. creatures/drift_snail.png   (female / default)
assets/sprites/creatures/<creature_id>_m.png  e.g. creatures/drift_snail_m.png (male)
assets/sprites/creatures/<creature_id>_baby.png  e.g. creatures/drift_snail_baby.png (juvenile)
assets/sprites/plants/<plant_id>.png          e.g. plants/bell_kelp.png
assets/sprites/decor/<decoration_id>.png      e.g. decor/castle.png
assets/sprites/misc/player.png | chest.png | bait.png
```

IDs are the `id` fields in `data/creatures.js` and `data/decorations.js` (lowercase, underscores).

Decorations are one static frame, face right (the aquarium can flip them), and sit on their bottom
row. Floating pieces (`kind: 'float'`, like the buoy and lily pad) hang from the surface: `hang` in
`data/decorations.js` sets how many pixels of the sprite dip below the waterline. Pieces with a `glow`
colour light up dark tanks around them, so leave their bright parts bright.

## Using a different layout

If a generated sheet needs a different frame size or frame count, edit its entry in
`assets/manifest.js` (`fw`, `fh`, `anchor`, `anims`) and add `"custom": true`. The placeholder
generator (`node tools/gen-placeholders.js`) will then leave that entry and its PNG alone. Without
`--force`, the generator never overwrites an existing PNG.

Preview every sheet, animated, at `tools/sprites.html` (served from a local web server).

## Scene pieces (the hill, the UFO, the aquarium building)

All live in `assets/sprites/scene/`. Replace a PNG with real art of the same size.

| key                  | size     | frames            | anchor        | notes |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| `misc.signpost`      | 16 × 24  | 1                 | bottom-centre | at the edge of Tide Pools, pointing left |
| `misc.ufo`           | 64 × 32  | 4 @ 6 fps         | centre        | hovers over the hilltop |
| `misc.beam`          | 32 × 96  | 4 @ 8 fps         | top-centre    | drawn translucent ("lighter" blend), stretched to the beam's width and length |
| `misc.beampad`       | 40 × 12  | 4 @ 6 fps         | bottom-centre | the beam pad in the building |
| `misc.console`       | 20 × 28  | 4 @ 6 fps         | bottom-centre | the tank directory |
| `misc.tank_frame`    | 64 × 44  | 1                 | bottom-centre | keep the window (x 4..59, y 4..35) transparent: the live tank shows through it |
| `bg.hill_sky`        | 320 × 180| 1                 | top-left      | fixed backdrop behind the hill |
| `bg.space`           | 320 × 180| 1                 | top-left      | must tile seamlessly (it scrolls slowly) |
| `bg.planet_ringed`, `bg.planet_small` | 56 × 32, 20 × 20 | 1 | top-left | distant planets |
| `tile.hill`          | 32 × 48  | 1                 | top-left      | row 0 = the grass surface, lower rows = soil by depth; tiles sideways |
| `tile.station_wall`, `tile.station_hull` | 32 × 32 | 1 | top-left | tiling wall / outer hull panels |
| `tile.station_floor` | 32 × 8   | 1                 | top-left      | row 0 is the walking surface |
| `tile.ladder`        | 16 × 8   | 1                 | top-left      | repeats vertically |

The player sheet also has row 7 `climb` (2 frames @ 6 fps), shown while on a ladder.
The hill's shape comes from `AQ.TUNING.hill`, and the building's layout from `data/scenes.js`, so the
art only supplies textures and props.
